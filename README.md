# Vibration Api Demo

This project is a demo to show how the `vibration API` works in a real world example. 

I also wrote an <a href="https://modern-web.hashnode.dev/vibration-api" target="_blank">article</a> about it on Hashnode, if you want to know more about this API.

ðŸ”¬ You can test it live [here](https://pacoita.github.io/vibration_api_demo/home)

I used Angular (version 11.x.x), but the API can be used with any JS framework of choice or even vanilla javascript.


## Run it locally

If you want to run the demo locally:

1. Clone the repo locally

2. Run `npm i` to install all the needed dependencies

3. Run `ng serve` for starting a local dev server for the demo.
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
